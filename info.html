	<h1>Ghats in Varanasi</h1>
	<div>
	As the proclaimed proverb in Sanskrit says, death 
	in Varanasi is a blessing for the devout. The abode
	of Lord Shiva, Varanasi or Kashi is the oldest 
	surviving city in the world as per Hindu mythology
	. It is believed that the first ray of light after
	the creation of this Universe fell upon Varanasi,
	sanctifying it for eternity. River Ganges, the ho
	liest river in Hinduism flows through the eternal
	city and beside the river stand the Ghats in Vara
	nasi, as the testament of the glorious amalgamati
	on of humanity and divinity. Older than tradition
	s and spectacular beyond imagination, these Ghats
	have witnessed the evolvement of humanity across 
	ages.
