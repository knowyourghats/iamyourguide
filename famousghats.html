<div id="p">Assi Ghat, also called as 'Saimbeda Tirtha', is the
 southernmost Ghat in Varanasi. Situated at the junction
 of Ganga and Assi rivers, Assi Ghat has been mentioned
 in numerous ancient Hindu scriptures like Matsya 
 Purana, Agni Purana, Kurma Purana, Padma Purana and 
 Kashi khanda. Legend says that upon slaying the 
 demons Shumbha-Nishumbha, Goddess Durga threw her 
 sword away. Her sword fell on earth with full force 
 creating a stream of a river, known as Assi River. 
 It is also believed that Tulsi Das wrote the epic 
 Ramcharitmanas on this very spot. Assi Ghat is today 
 one of the most prominent ghats in Varanasi, and 
 thousands of Hindu pilgrims take a holy dip here on 
 important occasions like Grahan, Dussehra, Probodhoni 
 Ekadashi, Makar Sankranti.</div>

 <div id="p">Dasaswamedh Ghat is one of the most well known 
 and one of the busiest ghats of Varanasi. The lite
 ral translation of Dasaswamedh means the sacrifice
 of ten horses. According to legends, ten horses we
 re sacrificed by Lord Brahma at this very site to 
 allow Lord Shiva to return from banishment. Owing
 to this mythological story, the ghat became famous

 are seen on the ghat every day, performing religio
 us rites along the banks of river Ganga. The most 
 significant attraction here is the grand Ganga Aar

	Manikarnika Ghat acts as the central cremation 
	site in Varanasi and is one of the oldest and 
	most sacred Ghats in Varanasi. According to 
	Hindu mythology, the person cremated here achiev
	es immediate liberation from the cycle of birth
	and rebirth. Manikarnika Ghat lies at the centre
	of the five major Tirtha Sthals and symbolises 
	both creation and destruction. Millions of people
	come down at this ghat to burn down the mortal 
	remains of their dear ones and pray to the flames
	for eternal peace of the soul. Also present here
	is a sacred well called the Manikarnika Kund, 
	wich is believed to be dug by Lord Vishnu at the
	time of creation of this world. The ashes of the
	burnt bodies make one remember the inevitable 
	destruction of everything in the world here.Considered as a gateway to the next life, Manikarnika Ghat is a highly sacred riverfront in India. 
It is believed that spending the last few days of life at the Ghat and completing the rituals of cremation here ensure a painless passing and also a way to attain freedom from the endless cycle of birth and death.

<div id ="p">
	Scindia Ghat borders Manikarnika to the north 
	and is governed by various myths and legends. 
	Hindu mythology considers the ghat to be the p
	lace of birth of Agni, the God of Fire. A Shiv
	a temple stands here partially submerged in Ga
	nga and is believed to be so heavy that it cau
	sed the ghat to collapse into the river. It is
	believed that the temple is sinking continuous
	ly since then and it will soon be submerged in
	water. Some of Varanasi's most revered shrines
	are located above Scindia ghat in an area know
	n as Siddha Kshetra. It is also a local belief
	that people who pray at this ghat get blessed 
	with a son. The ghat was built by a Scindia wo
	man in 1850 and thus came to be known as Scind
	ia Ghat. Boating alongside this ghat is a favo
	urite tourist activity.
