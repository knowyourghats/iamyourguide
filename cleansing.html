		Tulsi Ghat is another essential ghat of Varanasi
		. Named after the celebrated poet and saint Tulsidas

		mleela as per Hindu legends. It is believed that whe
		n Tulsidas composed the tremendous Indian epic Ramch
		aritmanas in Varanasi, his manuscript once fell into
		Ganga and rather than sinking, it kept floating
		over the river near this ghat. A temple of Lord
		Ram was built on the Ghat, and many relics of 
		Tulsidas are preserved at the Tulsi Ghat. The 
		house in which Tulsidas died has also been 
		retained and his Samadhi, wooden clogs, pillow
		and the idol of Hanuman, which Tulsi worshipped,
		all be still found intact here.

			Goddess Durga threw her sword away. Her sword fell 
			on earth with full force creating a stream of a 
			river, known as Assi River. It is also believed 
			that Tulsi Das wrote the epic Ramcharitmanas on 
			this very spot. Assi Ghat is today one of the most
			prominent ghats in Varanasi, and thousands of Hindu
			pilgrims take a holy dip here on important occasions
