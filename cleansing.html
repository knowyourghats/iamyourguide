		aritmanas in Varanasi, his manuscript once fell into
		Ganga and rather than sinking, it kept floating
		over the river near this ghat. A temple of Lord
		Ram was built on the Ghat, and many relics of 
		Tulsidas are preserved at the Tulsi Ghat. The 
		house in which Tulsidas died has also been 
		retained and his Samadhi, wooden clogs, pillow
		and the idol of Hanuman, which Tulsi worshipped,
		all be still found intact here.
